# ðŸŒˆ Color Tokens

https://color-tokens.vercel.app/

A prototype exploring a workflow for adding user-defined color tokens. Tokens can have an optional dark mode color, making it easier to build for both dark and light mode. For each token added, we create a CSS variable mapped to that token. If the token has a dark mode color variant, we'll update the variable definition when switching between color schemes.

npm run dev
